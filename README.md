# Brad's Personal DIDs Research Repository

This repository contains Bradley Matera's comprehensive academic research on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. They are designed to be globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. This research covers their theoretical foundations, diverse implementation methodologies across various platforms, and practical applications in emerging digital ecosystems.

## Key Concepts Covered

This research delves into fundamental components of the DID ecosystem, including:
*   **DID Syntax and Structure**: The standardized format of DID strings.
*   **DID Documents**: JSON documents containing metadata associated with a DID, such as cryptographic keys and service endpoints.
*   **DID Resolution**: The process of retrieving the DID Document associated with a DID.
*   **DID Controllers**: Entities authorized to make changes to a DID Document.
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Tamper-evident digital credentials cryptographically signed by an issuer, often utilizing DIDs for issuer and subject identification.
*   **DID Registries**: Systems (often blockchains or distributed ledgers) where DID Documents or references to them are stored.
