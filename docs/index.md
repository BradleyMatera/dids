## Table of Contents: Navigating the Research Landscape

This repository is organized into distinct sections, each addressing a critical aspect of DIDs:

1.  **[Overview of DIDs](overview/)**: Establishes the foundational knowledge base, defining DIDs, their core properties (persistence, resolvability, cryptographic verifiability, decentralization), the DID architecture (DID, DID Document, DID Methods, DID Resolver, Verifiable Data Registry), and their significance in addressing the limitations of traditional identity systems.
2.  **[DID Methods and Trust Models](methods/)**: Provides an in-depth exploration and comparative analysis of various DID methods (e.g., `did:key`, `did:web`, `did:ion`, `did:sov`, `did:ethr`, `did:btcr`), detailing their specific syntax, resolution mechanisms, underlying ledger technologies (or lack thereof), security trade-offs, and the trust models they inherently support (e.g., public ledger trust, web-based trust, peer-to-peer trust).
3.  **[Security and Privacy Considerations](security/)**: Delves into the critical aspects of security and privacy within the DID ecosystem. This includes analysis of cryptographic foundations (key management, signature schemes), potential attack vectors (e.g., resolution attacks, key compromise, correlation risks), privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and selective disclosure, and best practices for secure implementation.
4.  **[Future Outlook](future/)**: Explores the evolving horizon of DIDs, discussing ongoing research areas (e.g., scalability, interoperability, governance models), emerging trends (integration with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) wallets, Verifiable Credentials, IoT, AI), potential future developments, standardization efforts within bodies like W3C and DIF, and the potential societal impact.
5.  **[Current Adoption Landscape](adoption/)**: Presents an analysis of the current state of DID adoption across various sectors (finance, healthcare, supply chain, government), highlighting key industry players, consortia (e.g., Trust over IP Foundation, Hyperledger), open-source projects, pilot programs, and real-world deployments demonstrating the practical utility of DIDs.
6.  **[Application Domains](applications/)**: Showcases specific, detailed use cases and implementations of DIDs in diverse fields, illustrating their versatility:
    *   [IoT Device Authentication](applications/iot.md): Utilizing DIDs to establish secure, unique, and verifiable identities for IoT devices, enabling trusted device-to-device communication and data exchange.
    *   [AI Systems Integration](applications/ai.md): Investigating the role of DIDs in providing verifiable identities for AI agents, ensuring accountability, provenance, and secure interaction in complex AI ecosystems.
    *   [Education and Academic Credentials](applications/education.md): Applying DIDs and Verifiable Credentials to issue, hold, and verify digital academic records, diplomas, and skill certifications in a secure, portable, and learner-centric manner.
    *   [Secure Communications](applications/secure-messaging.md): Leveraging DIDs to enhance end-to-end trust, authentication, and security in messaging platforms, email systems, and other communication protocols.
7.  **[Implementation Guides](implementations/)**: Offers practical, hands-on guidance, code examples, and technical specifications for developers building DID-based solutions:
    *   [did:web and WebRTC Integration](implementations/web.md): Provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the `did:web` method using existing web infrastructure and integrating DID-based authentication with Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocols for secure peer-to-peer interactions.
