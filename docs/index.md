## Key Concepts Covered

This research delves into fundamental components of the DID ecosystem, including:

- **DID Syntax and Structure**: The standardized format of DID strings
- **DID Documents**: JSON documents containing metadata associated with a DID
- **DID Resolution**: The process of retrieving the DID Document associated with a DID
- **DID Controllers**: Entities authorized to make changes to a DID Document
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Tamper-evident digital credentials cryptographically signed by an issuer
- **DID Registries**: Systems where DID Documents or references to them are stored

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a dynamic and comprehensive academic resource for understanding, researching, and implementing Decentralized Identifiers. The content represents a synthesis of established theoretical frameworks, analysis of current standards (like W3C DID Core), and practical implementation insights, with particular emphasis on emerging standards, innovative approaches, and the evolving landscape of the decentralized identity ecosystem.
