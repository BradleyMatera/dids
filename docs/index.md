# Brad's Personal DIDs Research Repository

{% include navigation.md %}

Welcome to Bradley Matera's comprehensive academic research on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). This repository contains extensive research on DIDs, their theoretical foundations, diverse implementation methodologies across various platforms, and practical applications in emerging digital ecosystems.

## Research Structure

This documentation is systematically organized into the following key scholarly sections:

### Core Concepts and Overview

- [Overview of DIDs](./overview/) - Introduces the core concepts, architecture, and significance of Decentralized Identifiers in the context of digital identity

### Methods and Implementations

- [DID Methods and Trust Models](./methods/) - Explores various DID methods, their underlying mechanisms, and trust frameworks
- [Implementation Guides](./implementations/) - Provides practical guidance and examples for developers

### Security and Future Directions

- [Security and Privacy Considerations](./security/) - Analyzes security properties, vulnerabilities, and privacy-enhancing techniques
- [Future Outlook](./future/) - Discusses ongoing research, emerging trends, and standardization efforts

### Applications and Adoption

- [Current Adoption Landscape](./adoption/) - Examines the current state of DID adoption across different industries
- [Application Domains](./applications/) - Details specific use cases and implementations in various fields


## Key Concepts Covered

This research delves into fundamental components of the DID ecosystem, including:

- **DID Syntax and Structure**: The standardized format of DID strings
- **DID Documents**: JSON documents containing metadata associated with a DID
- **DID Resolution**: The process of retrieving the DID Document associated with a DID
- **DID Controllers**: Entities authorized to make changes to a DID Document
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Tamper-evident digital credentials cryptographically signed by an issuer
- **DID Registries**: Systems where DID Documents or references to them are stored

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a dynamic and comprehensive academic resource for understanding, researching, and implementing Decentralized Identifiers. The content represents a synthesis of established theoretical frameworks, analysis of current standards (like W3C DID Core), and practical implementation insights, with particular emphasis on emerging standards, innovative approaches, and the evolving landscape of the decentralized identity ecosystem.
