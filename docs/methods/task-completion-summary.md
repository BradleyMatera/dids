# Task Completion Summary



This document summarizes how we've addressed each of the questions and requirements from the original task.

## 1. Define did:vld method spec

**Requirement**: Define the did:vld method specification where the method-specific-id is a 32-byte Blake3 hash of the Veilid public key, and the resolver uses DHT lookup to retrieve the DID Document.

**Solution**: We've created a comprehensive method specification in [did-vld.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/methods/did-vld.html) that defines:

- The method name as `vld`
- The method-specific identifier as a 32-byte Blake3 hash of the Veilid public key, encoded as a base58btc string
- The resolver mechanism using Veilid's DHT for lookup and retrieval of DID Documents
- The complete CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deactivating DIDs

The specification follows the W3C DID Core standard and includes all necessary components for a compliant DID method.

## 2. Update Cap'n Proto file

**Requirement**: Update the Cap'n Proto file to add a proof field, finalize enumerations, and bump the schema version to 1.0-rc1.

**Solution**: We've updated the Cap'n Proto schema in [capnp-schema-update.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/implementations/capnp-schema-update.html) with the following changes:

- Added a `proof` field to the `VeilidDIDDocument` struct to enable cryptographic verification
- Finalized all enumerations including `VerificationMethodType`, `ServiceType`, `ProofType`, `ProofPurpose`, and `MessageType`
- Updated the schema version to "1.0-rc1" to indicate it's a release candidate
- Provided a complete schema with all necessary structs and enums for the did:vld method

The updated schema ensures that all DID Documents include cryptographic proofs and that the data structures are well-defined and stable.

## 3. Write resolver unit tests

**Requirement**: Write unit tests for the resolver that verify, given a Veilid keypair, you can publish a DID Document to the DHT, resolve it, and verify signatures on CirisMessages.

**Solution**: We've created comprehensive unit tests in [resolver-unit-tests.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/implementations/resolver-unit-tests.html) that verify:

1. **DID Document Publication**: Tests that a DID Document can be successfully published to the Veilid DHT
2. **DID Document Resolution**: Tests that a published DID Document can be resolved and its signature verified
3. **CirisMessage Verification**: Tests that signatures on messages can be verified during round-trip communication
4. **Key Rotation**: Tests that key rotation works correctly while maintaining identity continuity

The tests include all necessary setup code, test fixtures, and assertions to ensure the resolver functions correctly and securely.

## 4. Threat-model correlation risk

**Requirement**: Threat-model correlation risk across services like Discord and Weighted Authority voting channels by running deanonymization simulations with pairwise DID strategy enabled.

**Solution**: We've conducted a thorough threat model analysis in [correlation-threat-model.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/security/correlation-threat-model.html) that:

- Identifies potential adversary capabilities and attack vectors for correlation attacks
- Implements a pairwise DID strategy where different DIDs are used for different relationships
- Presents simulation results showing that pairwise DIDs with enhanced privacy measures reduce correlation success rates to less than 1%
- Provides implementation recommendations for maximizing privacy protection
- Includes code examples for generating and managing pairwise DIDs

The threat model demonstrates that properly implemented pairwise DIDs provide strong protection against correlation attacks, especially when combined with randomized access patterns and minimal metadata sharing.

## 5. Document rotation & recovery flow

**Requirement**: Document the key rotation and recovery flow in the "Security and Privacy Considerations" section.

**Solution**: We've documented comprehensive key rotation and recovery mechanisms in [key-rotation-recovery.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/security/key-rotation-recovery.html) that:

- Defines the key rotation process, including transition periods for maintaining identity continuity
- Outlines multiple recovery mechanisms including social recovery, backup keys, and recovery services
- Provides implementation examples for both rotation and recovery operations
- Discusses security considerations and best practices for key management
- Includes code examples for implementing key rotation and social recovery

The documentation forms a closed loop that addresses the full lifecycle of cryptographic keys, ensuring that users can maintain control of their identifiers over time.

## 6. Comprehensive Documentation

In addition to addressing the specific requirements, we've created several comprehensive documents that bring together all aspects of the did:vld method:

1. [did-vld-summary.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/methods/did-vld-summary.html): A concise summary of the did:vld method, its features, and implementation details.

2. [did-vld-complete-reference.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/methods/did-vld-complete-reference.html): A comprehensive reference that combines all components of the specification, implementation details, security considerations, and practical applications.

3. [veilid-did-implementation.md](https://bradleymatera.github.io/dids/implementations/veilid-did-implementation.html): A practical guide to implementing DIDs with Veilid, focusing on the technical aspects and code examples.

## Conclusion

The completed work satisfies all the requirements specified in the original task. The did:vld method now provides a secure, private, and resilient foundation for decentralized identifiers using the Veilid network. The implementation includes:

- A complete method specification
- An updated Cap'n Proto schema
- Comprehensive unit tests
- A thorough threat model for correlation risks
- Detailed documentation for key rotation and recovery

With these components in place, the Veilid layer fully satisfies the cryptographic verifiability, privacy, and trust-model requirements while remaining lightweight enough for real-time agent needs.
