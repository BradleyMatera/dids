## Overview

Traditional academic credentials (diplomas, certificates, transcripts) face several challenges:
- **Verification Delays**: Manual verification processes can take days or weeks.
- **Fraud Risk**: Paper documents can be forged or tampered with.
- **Portability Issues**: Physical credentials may be lost or damaged.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sharing full transcripts often reveals more information than necessary.

DIDs address these challenges by enabling:
- **Instant Verification**: Cryptographic proof of authenticity without contacting the issuing institution.
- **Tamper-Evidence**: Any alteration to a credential is immediately detectable.
- **Digital Portability**: Credentials stored in digital wallets are accessible anywhere.
- **Selective Disclosure**: Students can share only relevant parts of their academic record.

## Key Components

### Institutional DIDs

Educational institutions establish their digital identity through DIDs:

- **DID Creation**: Universities and schools create DIDs (often using methods like did:web or did:ion) to represent their issuing authority.
- **DID Document**: Contains public keys for verification and service endpoints for credential issuance.
- **Trust Framework**: Institutions may participate in governance frameworks that establish trust among educational entities.

**Example**: A university might use `did:web:university.edu` as its identifier, with the DID Document hosted at `https://university.edu/.well-known/did.json`.

### Student DIDs

Students maintain their own digital identities:

- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Students create and control their own DIDs.
- **Wallet Applications**: Digital wallets store credentials and manage private keys.
- **Authentication**: DIDs enable secure login to campus services and learning management systems.

### Verifiable Academic Credentials

Academic achievements are represented as Verifiable Credentials (VCs):

- **Credential Types**: Diplomas, degrees, certificates, transcripts, and micro-credentials.
- **Credential Structure**: Contains issuer DID, student DID, credential claims, and digital signature.
- **Verification Method**: Credentials can be verified by resolving the issuer's DID Document and checking the signature.

---

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Institutional Setup**:
   - Institution generates a DID and publishes its DID Document.
   - Institution establishes a credential issuance service.

2. **Student Onboarding**:
   - Student creates a DID (or uses an existing one).
   - Student registers their DID with the institution.

3. **Credential Issuance**:
   - Upon completion of academic requirements, the institution issues a VC to the student's DID.
   - The credential is digitally signed using the institution's private key.

4. **Credential Storage**:
   - Student stores the credential in their digital wallet.

5. **Verification Process**:
   - When needed, the student shares the credential with a verifier (employer, another institution).
   - The verifier resolves the issuing institution's DID, retrieves its public key, and verifies the signature.

## Use Cases

### Digital Diplomas and Certificates

- **Instant Issuance**: Graduates receive digital diplomas immediately upon completion.
- **Global Verification**: Employers worldwide can verify credentials without contacting the institution.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Digital signatures ensure authenticity and prevent forgery.

### Transcript Management

- **Selective Sharing**: Students share only relevant courses or grades.
- **Cumulative Records**: Transcripts from multiple institutions can be aggregated under one DID.
- **Lifelong Learning**: Continuous education achievements are added to the same digital identity.

### Campus Access and Services

- **Single Sign-On**: DID-based authentication for campus resources.
- **Secure Examinations**: Verified identity for online assessments.
- **Library and Resource Access**: Controlled access based on verified student status.

### Cross-Border Education

- **Credential Portability**: Academic achievements recognized across national boundaries.
- **Study Abroad Programs**: Seamless verification of prerequisites and earned credits.
- **Refugee Education**: Preserved academic history even when physical documents are lost.

## Technical Implementation

### Example: Issuing a Diploma as a Verifiable Credential

```javascript
// Institution's DID and keys (simplified)
const universityDID = "did:web:university.edu";
const universityPrivateKey = getPrivateKey(); // Securely stored

// Student's DID (received during registration)
const studentDID = "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK";

// Create the credential
async function issueDiploma(studentDID, degreeInfo) {
  const credential = {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.edu/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": universityDID,
    "issuanceDate": new Date().toISOString(),
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": studentDID,
      "degree": {
        "type": degreeInfo.type,
        "name": degreeInfo.name,
        "degreeSchool": "School of Computer Science",
        "graduationDate": degreeInfo.graduationDate
      }
    }
  };
  
  // Sign the credential
  const signedCredential = await signCredential(credential, universityPrivateKey);
  return signedCredential;
}

// Verification process (performed by an employer)
async function verifyDiploma(signedCredential) {
  // Resolve the issuer's DID Document
  const issuerDID = signedCredential.issuer;
  const issuerDidDocument = await resolveDID(issuerDID);
  
  // Extract the verification method (public key)
  const publicKey = issuerDidDocument.verificationMethod[0].publicKeyMultibase;
  
  // Verify the credential's signature
  const isValid = await verifySignature(signedCredential, publicKey);
  
  return {
    valid: isValid,
    issuer: issuerDID,
    subject: signedCredential.credentialSubject.id,
    degree: signedCredential.credentialSubject.degree
  };
}
```

### Example: Student Authentication with DID

```javascript
// Campus service authentication
async function authenticateStudent(studentDID, challenge, signature) {
  // Resolve student's DID Document
  const studentDidDocument = await resolveDID(studentDID);
  
  // Get authentication key
  const authKey = studentDidDocument.authentication[0].publicKeyMultibase;
  
  // Verify the signature on the challenge
  const isValid = await verifySignature(challenge, signature, authKey);
  
  if (isValid) {
    // Check if student has valid enrollment credential
    const enrollmentStatus = await checkEnrollmentCredential(studentDID);
    return {
      authenticated: true,
      enrolled: enrollmentStatus.active,
      studentId: enrollmentStatus.studentId
    };
  }
  
  return { authenticated: false };
}
```
