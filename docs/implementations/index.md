# DID Implementation Guides

This section provides detailed technical guides for implementing specific DID methods and integrating DIDs with various technologies. These guides focus on practical implementation details, code examples, and best practices.

## Available Implementation Guides

- [did:web and WebRTC Integration](web.md)

## Overview

While the conceptual understanding of DIDs is important, developers need concrete implementation guidance to successfully integrate DIDs into their systems. The guides in this section bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing:

1. Step-by-step implementation instructions
2. Working code examples
3. Integration patterns with existing technologies
4. Troubleshooting advice and best practices

Each guide is designed to be hands-on, focusing on the technical details that matter most to developers. Whether you're implementing a specific DID method or integrating DIDs with communication protocols like WebRTC, these guides provide the practical knowledge needed for successful implementation.

## Contributing New Implementation Guides

This section will expand over time to include additional DID methods and technology integrations. If you have expertise in a particular DID method or integration pattern, consider contributing a new implementation guide following the structure of the existing guides.
