# DID Implementation Guides

{% include navigation.md %}

This section provides detailed technical guides for implementing specific DID methods and integrating DIDs with various technologies. These guides focus on practical implementation details, code examples, and best practices that help developers transition from theoretical understanding to real-world applications.

## Available Implementation Guides

- **[did:web and WebRTC Integration](web.md)**  
  Learn how to implement the `did:web` method and integrate it with WebRTC for secure, real-time communication. This guide covers setting up a DID resolver using standard web infrastructure, configuring WebRTC connections for peer-to-peer communication, and handling cryptographic key management.

- **[Veilid DID Implementation](veilid-did-implementation.md)**  
  Comprehensive guide to implementing the `did:vld` method using the Veilid network. This implementation leverages Veilid's distributed hash table (DHT) and cryptographic primitives to create a secure, private, and resilient foundation for decentralized identifiers.

- **[Cap'n Proto Schema Update](capnp-schema-update.md)**  
  Technical details on the Cap'n Proto schema used for the `did:vld` method, providing efficient binary representation of DID-related data structures.

- **[Resolver Unit Tests](resolver-unit-tests.md)**  
  Documentation of unit tests for the `did:vld` resolver, ensuring it functions correctly and securely for DID resolution and verification.

## Overview

While a conceptual understanding of Decentralized Identifiers is essential, practical implementation guidance empowers developers to build robust and secure systems. The guides in this section bridge the gap between theory and practice through:

1. **Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions:** Detailed walkthroughs explaining each phase of the integrationâ€”from DID issuance and resolution to cryptographic signing and verification.
2. **Working Code Examples:** Concrete code snippets in popular programming languages (e.g., JavaScript) that illustrate common tasks and best practices.
3. **Integration Patterns with Existing Technologies:** Guidance on how to fit DID functionality into current identity management systems and communication protocols, enhancing interoperability.
4. **Troubleshooting Advice and Best Practices:** Common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate issues that may arise during implementation, ensuring a smooth development process.

These guides are designed to be hands-on resources for developers, whether integrating DIDs into legacy systems or building new decentralized applications from the ground up.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Security:**  
  Ensure robust key management practices, including the use of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure key rotation policies. Always use cryptographic best practices for signing and verifying data.

- **Interoperability:**  
  Adhere to established standards such as the W3C DID Core and Verifiable Credentials Data Model. This increases the likelihood that the implemented solutions will work seamlessly with other DID-enabled systems and digital wallets.

- **Scalability:**  
  Design your implementations to handle large volumes of DID resolution and verification requests. Consider caching strategies and efficient query processing methods.

- **Documentation and Testing:**  
  Maintain clear documentation for each implementation step and provide comprehensive tests to validate functionality. This aids in maintenance and future contributions to the project.

## Contributing New Implementation Guides

We welcome contributions from the community! As the ecosystem evolves and new DID methods and integrations emerge, this section will continuously expand to include additional guides. When contributing, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Adherence to Standards:**  
   Ensure your guide aligns with relevant W3C and industry standards.

2. **Clear Structure:**  
   Your guide should include an overview, step-by-step instructions, code examples, best practices, and troubleshooting tips similar to the existing guides.

3. **Quality Documentation:**  
   Provide thorough documentation that explains both the conceptual underpinnings and technical details of your implementation.

4. **Community Collaboration:**  
   Engage in discussions on proposed changes or new guides through our issue tracker or contribution channels. We value feedback that improves reproducibility and clarity.

By contributing, you help build a rich repository of knowledge that can drive the adoption and effective implementation of DIDs across various industries.
