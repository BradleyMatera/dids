## Introduction

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) empower users and devices to create and manage identities without reliance on centralized authorities. did:web leverages the existing web infrastructure (DNS and HTTPS) to host and resolve DID Documents. When combined with WebRTC—an open framework for real-time communications in browsers—we have a powerful foundation for establishing secure, direct, and authenticated peer-to-peer communications. This guide explains how to implement such an integration, enabling web applications to leverage decentralized, cryptographically verifiable identities in their real-time communication flows.

## Overview of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and did:web

### What is did:web?

**did:web** is a DID method that uses conventional web hosting as its verifiable data registry. A did:web identifier is derived from a domain name and optionally path segments. For example:

```
did:web:example.com
```

or for a user-specific identifier:

```
did:web:example.com:users:alice
```

The corresponding DID Document is hosted at a predictable URL (e.g., `https://example.com/.well-known/did.json` or a subpath such as `https://example.com/users/alice/did.json`). This method makes use of existing web infrastructure (DNS, HTTP/TLS) to deliver DID security properties without needing dedicated blockchain or distributed ledger systems.

### Key Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- **Ease of Adoption:** Leverages existing web servers and standards.
- **No Additional Cost:** Typically does not require blockchain transaction fees.
- **Human-Friendly:** Uses recognizable domain names.

**Limitations:**
- **Centralization Risk:** Inherits security risks from DNS and TLS infrastructure.
- **Not Fully Pseudonymous:** Domain names in the identifier may reveal organizational or personal details.
- **Update and Revocation:** Relies on web hosting practices; lacks inherent on-chain immutability.

## WebRTC Fundamentals

### What is WebRTC?

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project and set of APIs enabling real-time voice, video, and data sharing between browsers and mobile applications. It supports peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without needing external plugins.

### Core Components of WebRTC

- **RTCPeerConnection:** Manages the connection between peers by handling ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment), media exchange, and data channels.
- **RTCDataChannel:** Allows direct peer-to-peer data exchange.
- **MediaStream:** Manages audio and video streams.
- **Signaling Mechanism:** Although not defined by WebRTC, signaling is required for exchanging session description protocol (SDP) messages to establish connections.

## Integration of did:web with WebRTC

### Why Combine did:web and WebRTC?

By combining did:web with WebRTC, you can achieve:
- **Decentralized Identity Verification:** Peer identities are cryptographically verifiable using DID Documents.
- **Enhanced Trust:** Each peer can trust the authentication of connection requests using DID-based digital signatures.
- **Secure Signaling:** Incorporate DID authentication into the signaling process to prevent impersonation and ensure secure, authenticated communication.

### Security and Authentication Considerations

- **Verification Process:** Peers resolve each other’s did:web Documents from their respective domains to obtain public keys.
- **DID-based Signature:** Prior to or during the WebRTC signaling exchange, peers can sign messages using their private keys corresponding to the keys published in the did:web Document.
- **Integration:** The application can embed DID resolution within its WebRTC signaling server (or use a decentralized signaling mechanism) to perform real-time authentication.

## Implementation using JavaScript, HTML, and WebRTC

### Prerequisites and Setup

- **Web Server:** To host the did:web Document (e.g., Apache, NGINX, or a simple Node.js server).
- **Modern Browser:** With support for WebRTC APIs (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- **JavaScript Libraries:** Use libraries like [did-resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) or custom code to perform DID resolution.
- **Signaling Server:** Basic WebSocket or similar server to exchange SDP messages between peers.

### Architectural Overview

1. **dID Setup and Hosting:** Each peer registers a did:web Document on its respective domain.
2. **DID Resolution Integration:** Each client application implements DID resolution logic to fetch a peer's DID Document.
3. **WebRTC Connection Setup:** Peers initiate a WebRTC session using a signaling channel.
4. **Authentication Layer:** Embed digital signatures in signaling messages, verifying them using the resolved DID Document.

### Step-by-Step Development Guide

#### 1. Generating a did:web Identifier

- Decide a domain and path structure (e.g., `did:web:example.com:users:alice`).
- Create a DID Document in JSON format and host it at a well-known URL (e.g., `https://example.com/users/alice/did.json`).

#### 2. Hosting and Resolving the did:web Document

- **Hosting:** Store your DID Document on a secure web server. Ensure proper HTTP/TLS configuration.
- **Resolving:** In your JavaScript code, implement a function that maps the did:web identifier to its URL. For example:

```javascript
function resolveDidWeb(did) {
  // Remove "did:web:" and convert colon-separated components to URL path
  const parts = did.replace("did:web:", "").split(":");
  let url = `https://${parts[0]}`;
  if (parts.length > 1) {
    url += "/" + parts.slice(1).join("/");
  }
  // Append the standard file if needed
  url += "/did.json";
  return fetch(url).then(response => response.json());
}
```

#### 3. Establishing a WebRTC Peer Connection

- Create an RTCPeerConnection and set up the WebRTC data or media channel.
- Use your chosen signaling method (for example, WebSocket) to exchange session descriptions (SDP).

#### 4. Integrating DID-based Authentication into WebRTC Signaling

- When sending SDP offers or ICE candidates for peer connection setup, include a digital signature of the message.
- On receiving a signaling message, resolve the sender’s did:web Document and verify the signature.

**Example Pseudocode in JavaScript:**

```javascript
// Signaling message structure
async function sendSignalingMessage(message, senderDid, senderPrivateKey) {
  // Convert message object to string
  const messageString = JSON.stringify(message);
  // Sign the message using a crypto library (e.g., SubtleCrypto)
  const signature = await signMessage(messageString, senderPrivateKey);
  // Include sender DID and signature in the message payload
  const signedMessage = {
    did: senderDid,
    message: message,
    signature: signature
  };
  signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify(signedMessage));
}

// On receiving a signaling message
async function onSignalingMessage(event) {
  const receivedData = JSON.parse(event.data);
  const { did, message, signature } = receivedData;
  // Resolve the sender's DID Document
  const didDocument = await resolveDidWeb(did);
  const publicKey = didDocument.verificationMethod[0].publicKeyMultibase;
  const messageString = JSON.stringify(message);
  const valid = await verifySignature(messageString, signature, publicKey);
  if (!valid) {
    console.error("Invalid signature. Discarding message.");
    return;
  }
  // Process the valid signaling message
  processSignalingMessage(message);
}
```

*Note:* Implementation would require using cryptographic functions from libraries or Web Crypto API, and the exact signature methodologies would depend on your chosen key system (for instance, Ed25519).

### Example Code Snippets

Below are simplified examples to illustrate the main points:

- **HTML Setup:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>DID Web & WebRTC Integration</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>DID Web & WebRTC Demo</h1>
  <div id="status">Initializing...</div>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

- **JavaScript (app.js):**

```javascript
// Example: Resolve a did:web identifier and output DID Document
const did = "did:web:example.com:users:alice";
resolveDidWeb(did).then(doc => {
  console.log("Resolved DID Document: ", doc);
});

// Setup WebRTC connection and signaling with DID-based authentication
const signalingChannel = new WebSocket("wss://your-signaling-server.example.com");

signalingChannel.onmessage = onSignalingMessage;

// Placeholder functions: signMessage, verifySignature
async function signMessage(message, privateKey) {
  // Implement using SubtleCrypto or an external library (e.g., tweetnacl)
  return "digital-signature-placeholder";
}

async function verifySignature(message, signature, publicKey) {
  // Implement signature verification
  return true; // placeholder true for demonstration
}

function processSignalingMessage(message) {
  console.log("Processing signaling message:", message);
  // Process incoming SDP/ICE messages as required
}
```

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

- **Secure Hosting:** Ensure your did:web Document is hosted on a secure server with HTTPS and maintained DNS records.
- **Key Management:** Use hardware-backed keys or secure browser storage to prevent key theft.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in DID resolution and signature verification to handle network issues or compromised data.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the full signaling flow, including simulated adversary scenarios (e.g., invalid signatures).
